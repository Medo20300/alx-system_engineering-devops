Postmortem Report: Service Outage on June 1, 2024
Issue Summary
Duration of the Outage:
June 1, 2024, 14:00 - 15:30 UTC

![post morteM](https://github.com/Medo20300/alx-system_engineering-devops/assets/135258669/03d261db-30a4-4883-903f-813c6c41bbf7)


Impact:
Our primary web application was completely inaccessible to users. Approximately 90% of our users experienced service disruptions, resulting in the inability to log in, access data, or perform transactions.

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, which led to all incoming traffic being directed to a single server that subsequently failed due to overload.

Timeline
14:00 - Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating high error rates and dropped connections.
14:02 - Engineering team receives automated alert and begins investigation.
14:10 - Initial hypothesis: Database server overload; database team contacted.
14:20 - Database team confirms no issues on their end; focus shifts to web servers.
14:30 - Misleading path: Investigation into recent code deployment finds no anomalies.
14:45 - Network team brought in to check for possible routing issues.
15:00 - Root cause identified as load balancer misconfiguration.
15:05 - Load balancer configuration corrected, and servers restarted.
15:20 - Service gradually restored and monitored for stability.
15:30 - All services back to normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The outage was traced back to a recent configuration change in the load balancer. A new routing rule intended to improve performance was incorrectly set, causing all user traffic to be funneled to a single application server. This server quickly became overwhelmed, leading to crashes and unavailability of the service.

Resolution:
Once the root cause was identified, the configuration change was reverted. The load balancer settings were corrected to properly distribute traffic across all available servers. Additionally, a full restart of the application servers was performed to ensure all services were functioning correctly. Post-recovery monitoring confirmed the resolution was effective, and normal operations resumed.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:

Configuration Management: Review and improve the change management process for load balancer configurations to prevent erroneous updates.
Monitoring Enhancements: Enhance monitoring to detect and alert on abnormal traffic patterns and server load issues sooner.
Load Testing: Implement more rigorous load testing procedures to simulate configuration changes and their impacts before deployment.
Tasks to Address the Issue:

Patch Load Balancer Configuration: Immediately audit and patch the load balancer settings to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Add Detailed Logging: Improve logging around load balancer and traffic routing to facilitate quicker diagnostics.
Implement Automated Rollback: Develop automated rollback mechanisms for load balancer configuration changes to quickly revert to a known good state if issues arise.
Enhance Training: Conduct training sessions for the engineering team on the importance of careful configuration management and the specifics of load balancer operations.
Regular Load Testing: Schedule regular load tests that mimic various failure scenarios, ensuring the system's robustness under different conditions.
By addressing these areas, we aim to prevent future outages and enhance the resilience of our services. The immediate actions and long-term measures will contribute to more stable and reliable operations, ensuring minimal disruption to our users.
